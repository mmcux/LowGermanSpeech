# LowGermanSpeech
Low German Text-to-Speech

## Abstract

This repository is dedicated to the development of a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and potentially an **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** system for the Low German language. This project aims to contribute to the preservation and accessibility of Low German by creating the first-of-its-kind speech technology for this language.

## Milestones

1. **Research and Data Collection:** Understand the phonetics and phonology of Low German and collect a substantial amount of text and speech data in Low German.

2. **Text-to-Speech Development:** Develop a TTS system that can convert written Low German text into spoken language.

3. **Testing and Refinement of TTS:** Test the TTS system extensively and refine it based on feedback and test results.

4. **Automatic Speech Recognition Development (Optional):** If feasible, develop an ASR system that can convert spoken Low German into written text.

5. **Testing and Refinement of ASR (Optional):** Test the ASR system extensively and refine it based on feedback and test results.

6. **Deployment and Distribution:** Make the TTS and ASR systems available for public use and gather feedback for future improvements.

We welcome contributions and suggestions to improve this project!
