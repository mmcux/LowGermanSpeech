# 🎙️ LowGermanSpeech: Low German Text-to-Speech 🎙️
Low German Text-to-Speech

## 📜 Abstract

This repository is dedicated to the development of a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and potentially an **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** system for the Low German language. This project aims to contribute to the preservation and accessibility of Low German by creating the first speech technology for this language.

## 🚀 Milestones

- [ ] **Research and Data Collection:** Understand the phonetics and phonology of Low German and collect a substantial amount of text and speech data in Low German.
- [ ] **Text-to-Speech Development:** Develop a TTS system that can convert written Low German text into spoken language.
- [ ] **Testing and Refinement of TTS:** Test the TTS system extensively and refine it based on feedback and test results.
- [ ] **Automatic Speech Recognition Development (Optional):** If feasible, develop an ASR system that can convert spoken Low German into written text.
- [ ] **Testing and Refinement of ASR (Optional):** Test the ASR system extensively and refine it based on feedback and test results.
- [ ] **Deployment and Distribution:** Make the TTS and ASR systems available for public use and gather feedback for future improvements.
